How to capture network traffic? SPAN vs TAP

What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
>A network TAP (Terminal Access Point) is a hardware device which can passively capture traffic on a network. It is commonly used to monitor the traffic between two points in the network. If the network between these two points consists of a physical cable, a network TAP may be the best way to capture traffic.

>Port mirroring, also known as SPAN or roving analysis, is a method of monitoring network traffic which forwards a copy of each incoming and/or outgoing packet from one (or several) port(s) (or VLAN) of a switch to another port where the analysis device is connected. 

What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?

1) Switches
2) Routers
3) TAPs
4) Network Load Balancers
5) Network Security Appliances like firewalls

How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
1) intrusion detection
2) Malware analysis
3) Network Forensics

Are a few ways.

Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
> Potentially if doing so allows one to reassemble private information that could then be used for other than its original intent.
