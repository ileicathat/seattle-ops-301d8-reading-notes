Reading

Computer Network - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)

Explain each of the three A’s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.

1) Authentication is checking to see if someone is who they say they are
2) Authorization is like a set of rules that determines what actions or resources a user may hve access to.
3) Accounting is basically logging or recording all of the activities of users to a system like what did they use or open and when and for how long.

What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
>Log it

What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
> Network Access Server (NAS) sends authentication requests to the ACS server and the server takes the decision to allow the user to access the network resource or not according to the credentials provided by the user. 

RADIUS Concepts

What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
1) User profiles kept in a central database that remote servers can share
2) easier to track usage for billing for access
3) designed to support large numbers of users connecting remotely to ISP.
What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
> Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service

Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
1) PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)
2) CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
3) MS-CHAP (Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
4) EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
