What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

Explain the role of a Domain Controller?
> When a computer is joined to a domain, it doesnâ€™t use its own local user accounts. User accounts and passwords are managed on the domain controller. When you log into a computer on that domain, the computer authenticates your user account name and password with the domain controller. This means you can log in with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain.

What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?
> Expanded access and less powerful client computers needed. If someone gets the access codes, they have many places to be able to gain access.

Describe how group policies are used in domains?
> Allows an admin to override local client settings, set whole groups to allow or restrict or do actions at the same time while leaving other groups alone.
