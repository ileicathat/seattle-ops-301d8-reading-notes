What is a Site-to-Site VPN?

### What is a site-to-site VPN?
>A site-to-site VPN tunnel encrypts traffic at one end and sends it to the other site over the public Internet where it is decrypted and routed on to its destination.

### What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?
>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).

### What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?
>Secure connectivity, Access control, Internal network like management between multiple business sites. 

## Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.

### Remote Access VPNs (Client Server???)

>A remote access VPN refers to a temporary connection set up between two or more users and a central location. This is good for companies with remote workers either on the road or in their homes. To still be able to access secure servers from the company while away from the office.
### Intranet-based Site-to-Site
>An intranet-based site-to-site VPN connects more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN). This is helpful if each site either develops its own resources or houses unique processes that the entire company would benefit from having access to.

### Extranet-based Site-to-Site
>Extranet-based site-to-site VPNs are often used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private. Each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make available to the other companies. In this way, they can collaborate and share without exposing proprietary data.
